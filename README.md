# Stryda CSS Framework

A [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for building the [css-framework library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@g-loot/css-framework), creating functional prototypes and hosting our brand guidelines.

The Stryda CSS Framework is a centralised front-end design system that allows any developer to quickly build pages that are **consistent** with the Stryda brand and its user interface system.

Based on the utility-first framework  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), the Stryda CSS Framework provides **pre-defined components** listed as well as highly composable, low-level **utility classes** to build complex user interfaces with speed in mind.

The main purpose of this repository is to create and maintain the various **css files** and the **tailwind theme** that are consumed by the various Stryda products.
